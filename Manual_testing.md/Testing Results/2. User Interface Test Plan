- **Scenario 2**:
  - **Result**: Fail X
  - **Notes**: 
  -For the index page, input.html is misaligned at the bottom of the footer
  -For adva.html, I want to have an image with a calculation in the middle
  -For result.hmtl slightly up, so result and result
  -For weigghgoals.html of shrinking the screen, not aligning responsively, it crashes
  -For macronutrients, I should have larger intervals between, for example, breakfast and lunch snack2 and dinner
  -For menu.html in the middle of the application and responsively - when changing the application, the big circle can be placed elsewhere
  -For add food.html I want to have a next button below the save button
  -For recipe.html I want to have the recipes display at the top and everything in the center of the page

- **Scenario 3**: X

Calorie Calculator App Development Plan

Description:
The Calorie Calculator App calculates daily caloric intake based on user inputs such as age, gender, weight, height, activity level, and weight goals. It provides users with personalized recommendations to maintain, gain, or lose weight based on their goals and lifestyle.

Preview:
The app will include:

Input Forms: For users to enter their details (age, gender, weight, height, activity level, weight goals).
Calculation Logic: To determine daily caloric needs.
Output Display: To show recommended daily caloric intake.
Getting Started:

Prerequisites:

Web Browser: Any modern web browser.
Code Editor: A code editor like Visual Studio Code.
Usage:
The Calorie Calculator App includes several key features:

Input Forms: Users enter their details to calculate caloric needs.
Calculation Logic: Based on user inputs, the app computes daily caloric requirements.
Output Display: Provides personalized recommendations for maintaining, gaining, or losing weight.
Future Developments:
The application will be enhanced with the following capabilities:

Calorie Requirement Calculation: Users will input personal data (e.g., age, gender, height, weight, and physical activity level). Based on these inputs, the app will calculate daily caloric needs.
Personalized Recommendations: The app will offer tailored recommendations for maintaining current weight, gaining weight, or losing weight. Recommendations will be customized to individual user needs, including specific goals and preferences.
Testing:
During the development of this application, I will perform manual tests, which will be detailed in the project documentation. Additionally, I plan to implement automated tests to ensure that all application functions operate correctly and efficiently.

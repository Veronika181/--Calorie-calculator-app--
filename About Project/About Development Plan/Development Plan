Development plan

"Completed, checkmarked with a tick" 

**1.Planning and Preparation**

Definition of Product Backlog:
-List all calculator(basic and advanced operations,used interface) Tool:  Github Issues
-Prioritize functions based on user importance.                            

Sprint(Iterations): Division of work into sprints, each lasting 1 -2 weeks.

For sprint management, I can use:
Jira: Planning and tracking sprints, managing backlog, and assigning tasks.
Asana: Creating projects, tasks, and sprint timelines.
GitHub Projects: Utilizing project boards in GitHub for sprint and task management.


Sprint 1: Basic Functions
Goal: Implementation of basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) in JavaScript.
Tasks: Setting up development environment, implementing operations, creating a simple button-based interface, testing.
    -UI Implementation: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
                        Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS 
    -Testing: Jest or Mocha, Selenium


Sprint 2: User Interface and Interactions
Goal: Creation of user-friendly interface.
Tasks: Wireframe design of interface, UI implementation (HTML, CSS, JS), adding interactivity, UI testing.
    Wireframe Design: Figma
    UI Implementation:HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React or Vue.js
    UI Testing: Manual testing- testing functionality and responsiveness of UI.


Sprint 3: Advanced Functions
Goal: Addition of advanced operations (percentages, powers, square roots).
Tasks: Implementation of advanced operations, integration into UI, testing.
    Implementation: JavaScript: Continuing use of JavaScript for adding new operations.
    Integration into UI: Adjustments to existing UI for incorporating new functionalities.
    Testing:Ensuring new functionalities work smoothly with existing features.

Sprint 4: Testing and Optimization
Goal: Conducting unit tests, integration tests, performance optimization, bug fixes.
    Testing:Jest, Mocha: For unit and integration testing.
    Load Impact or JMeter: Tools for performance testing.
    Optimization:Webpack or Gulp: For bundling and optimizing assets.
    Bug Fixes: Using issue tracking tools for prioritizing and fixing bugs.


Sprint 5: Documentation and Deployment
Goal: Detailed documentation of code and application, deployment to platform (GitHub Pages, Netlify), final testing.
    Documentation: Markdown: For README files and code documentation.
                    Swagger: For API documentation, if applicable.
    Deployment:GitHub Pages, Netlify: Platforms for hosting static websites.
               Final Testing: Conducting comprehensive testing before deployment.

**2. Daily Stand-up Meetings**
Structure of Daily Stand-up:
What I have completed since the last Stand-up:
Example: "Implemented addition function in calculator."
What I plan to do today:

Example: "Today, I will focus on implementing subtraction function."
Any obstacles or issues:
Example: "Facing issues with setting up testing environment."

Tool For into Jira, Trello, Asana or GitHubIssues 

**3. Code and Project Documentation**
README File:

Project Name:
Provide the name of your project.

Description:
Brief description of what your project does and its purpose.

Installation:
Instructions on how to install your project (e.g., required packages, installation steps).

Usage:
Detailed guide on how to use your project (e.g., how to run the application, how to utilize specific functions).

Examples:
Code snippets or images illustrating the functionality of your project.

Contributing:
Information on how others can contribute to your project (e.g., guidelines for pull requests acceptance).

License:
Information about the license under which your project is released.

Conclusion
This structured plan will help you effectively manage your project and maintain high quality and clarity of your code and documentation. Regular practice of daily Stand-up meetings and updating documentation during development will enable you to work efficiently even as an individual contributor.

!!!! I need to choose a tool For into Jira, Trello, Asana or GitHubIssues !!!!

Finish app Calorie calculator app 

next step 
according to the results of the values, the application will propose a menu by days

adding individual foods to mix it according to the results

or next step Create meal prep I can enter individual foods myself and it will show me how many kcals and proteins, carbs and fats, and how much more I can eat per day

and next next step including daily activity plus exercise
